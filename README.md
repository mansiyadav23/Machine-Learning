Classification Modeling Case Study

## Windows vs. Macbook
Countless consumers have pondered this question when preparing to buy a new computer. As a result, Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) have been rigorously researching several aspects of consumer buying behavior in regards to the decision making behind this question. Both firms have commissioned research and analysis teams to study aspects such as system architecture, security, and overall performance.


Recently, Microsoft has decided to approach this question from the perspective of the Big Five personality traits as well as the Hult DNA. As such, your team has been commissioned to run an analysis on these factors. Microsoft is looking forward to receiving your key insights, as well as an organized Jupyter Notebook that can be shared with their internal analytical teams. They also have sent you a kind reminder to utilize external research to support your findings and to give details related to important information such as audience size.


The Big Five personality test measures the five personality factors that psychologists have determined are core to our personality makeup. The Five Factors of personality are:

Openness - How open a person is to new ideas and experiences

Conscientiousness - How goal-directed, persistent, and organized a person is

Extraversion - How much a person is energized by the outside world

Agreeableness - How much a person puts others' interests and needs ahead of their own

Neuroticism - How sensitive a person is to stress and negative emotional triggers


## Analysis

In this analysis we will look into 392 survey responders that answered 77 questions. We will look into separating the types of questions into their Big Five personality traits. We will also separate the Hult DNA questions into 3 groups based on information provided in the Hult Handbook. Using this information we will explore the data and determine if there are any overarching insights prior to diving deeper into the analysis.

After exploration, we will organize our data and utilize unsupervised machine learning techniques - PCAs and Clustering to determine the types of customer that would purchase either a Macbook or Windows computer. Our goal is to help Microsoft determine unique customers that can be isolated and find out which customers are more inclined to remain or switch from their current laptop owned.
